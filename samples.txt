Beginning review of the axial images, I note the presence of a right upper lobe mass, approximately 3 cm in diameter, with spiculated margins, suggesting a primary malignant etiology. There are also multiple, smaller nodular opacities in both lung fields, highly suggestive of metastatic disease. These findings are new compared to the prior study dated January 15, 2024, which showed no evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.

Further evaluation of the mediastinum shows enlarged lymph nodes at the right hilar and mediastinal regions, particularly in the prevascular and subcarinal spaces, with the largest node measuring about 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter. This lymphadenopathy is concerning for nodal metastasis.

There are no signs of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The adjacent cardiac and upper abdominal structures appear normal.

Impression:

	1.	New right upper lobe mass with characteristics highly suggestive of primary lung cancer.
	2.	Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules likely representing metastatic disease.
	3.	Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy suggesting nodal involvement.
Recommend biopsy of the lung mass for histopathological confirmation, and consider oncology referral for comprehensive management. Follow-up imaging in three months is recommended to assess progression and response to therapy, if initiated.
